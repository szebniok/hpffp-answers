Intermission 2
==============

Next, take a look at the following code examples and try to decide if they will work, what result they will return if they do, and why or
why not:
1. `max (length [1, 2, 3]) (length [8, 9, 10, 11, 12])`  
   **OK!** `5`
2. `compare (3 * 4) (3 * 5)`  
   **OK!** `LT`
3. `compare "Julie" True`  
   **Type mismatch: can't compare String with Bool**
4. `(5 + 3) > (3 + 6)`  
   **OK** `False`
