Look at the types given for quotRem and divMod. What do you think those functions do? Test your hypotheses by playing with them
in the REPL. Weâ€™ve given you a sample to start with below:
```
Prelude> let ones x = snd (divMod x 10)
```

**Answer:** These functions return a tuple containing results of functions quot and rem, as well as div and mod respectively
