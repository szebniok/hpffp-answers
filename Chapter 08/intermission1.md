```haskell
applyTimes :: (Eq a, Num a) =>
               a -> (b -> b) -> b -> b
applyTimes 0 f b = b
applyTimes n f b = f (applyTimes (n-1) f b)

applyTimes' :: (Eq a, Num a) =>
               a -> (b -> b) -> b -> b
applyTimes' 0 f b = b
applyTimes' n f b = f . applyTimes' (n-1) f $ b
```

Write out the evaluation of the following. It might be a little less noisy if you do so with the form that didnâ€™t use (.).
```haskell
applyTimes 5 (+1) 5
```


**Answer:**

```haskell
applyTimes 5 (+1) 5 = (+1) (applyTimes (5-1) (+1) 5)
                    
                      (+1) (applyTimes 4 (+1) 5)
                      
                      (+1) ( (+1) (applyTimes (4-1) (+1) 5) )
                      
                      (+1) ( (+1) (applyTimes 3 (+1) 5) )
                      
                      (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) (applyTimes (3-1) (+1) 5) ) )
                      
                      (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) (applyTimes 2 (+1) 5) ) )
                      
                      (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) (applyTimes (2-1) (+1) 5) ) ) )
                      
                      (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) (applyTimes 1 (+1) 5) ) ) )
                      
                      (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) (applyTimes (1-1) (+1) 5) ) ) ) )
                      
                      (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) (applyTimes 0 (+1) 5) ) ) ) )
                      
                      (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) 5 ) ) ) )
                      
                      (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) 6 ) ) )
                      
                      (+1) ( (+1) ( (+1) 7 ) )
                      
                      (+1) ( (+1) 8 )
                      
                      (+1) 9
