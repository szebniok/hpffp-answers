1. Which (two or more) of the following are equivalent?  
   a) `mTh x y z = x * y * z`  
   b) `mTh x y = \z -> x * y * z`  
   c) `mTh x = \y -> \z -> x * y * z`  
   d) `mTh = \x -> \y -> \z -> x * y * z`  
   Answer: All definitions are equivalent
2. The type of mTh (above) is Num a => a -> a -> a -> a.  
   Which is the type of mTh 3?  
   a) `Integer -> Integer -> Integer`  
   b) `Num a => a -> a -> a -> a`  
   c) `Num a => a -> a`  
   d) `Num a => a -> a -> a`  
   Answer: `d)`
3. Next, weâ€™ll practice writing anonymous lambda syntax.  
   For example, one could rewrite:
   ```haskell
   addOne x = x + 1
   ```
   Into:
   ```haskell
   addOne = \x -> x + 1
   ```
   Try to make it so it can still be loaded as a top-level definition by GHCi. This will make it easier to validate your answers.  
   
   a) Rewrite the f function in the where clause.
   ```haskell
   addOneIfOdd n = case odd n of
     True -> f n
     False -> n
     where f n = n + 1
   ```
   ```haskell
   addOneIfOdd n = case odd n of
     True -> f n
     False -> n
     where f = \n -> n + 1 
   ```
   b) Rewrite the following to use anonymous lambda syntax:
   ```haskell
   addFive x y = (if x > y then y else x) + 5
   ```
   ```haskell
   addFive :: Integral a => a -> a -> a
   addFive = \x y -> (if x > y then y else x) + 5
   ```
   c) Rewrite the following so that it doesnâ€™t use anonymous lambda syntax:
   ```haskell
   mflip f = \x -> \y -> f y x
   ```
   ```haskell
   mflip f x y = f y x
   ```
